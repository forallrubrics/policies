#PRIVACY POLICY & TERMS OF USE

##PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information with ForAllRubrics. This Policy applies if you're using our mobile application, or if you're visiting our web site at www.forallrubrics.com or sites powered by ForAllRubrics (together, the "ForAllRubrics Service"). 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the ForAllRubrics Terms of Use by this reference. In addition to reviewing our Privacy Policy, you should also read ForAllRubrics Terms of Use. Your use of the ForAllRubrics Service constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site or application, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you reside outside the United States, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By using the ForAllRubrics Service and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S.

What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person, such as information about his or her use of the ForAllRubrics Service. Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic location and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the ForAllRubrics Service.

Children's Information

If you are under the age of 18, you may only use the ForAllRubrics Service and disclose information to us with your parent's or guardian's express consent. Please carefully review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and make sure you understand it. We collect personal information through the ForAllRubrics Service from a child under 13 where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us for use with the ForAllRubrics Service. If you are a child under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself if such parental consent has not been obtained. Further, please do not send any personal information other than what is necessary to participate in the ForAllRubrics Service. 

In the event that ForAllRubrics learns that it has collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that ForAllRubrics might have any information from or about a child under 13 in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@forallrubrics.com.

How We Collect Information

We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit the ForAllRubrics Service. For example, we collect registration and account information from teachers, parents and students, which may include your name, user name, email address, phone number, profile picture, school affiliation and location. We also collect personal information when you (1) download the mobile software application, (2) send an invitation, (3) ask others to collaborate on your classroom or (4) contact us by email or otherwise for any reason. 

When you visit the ForAllRubrics Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your mobile device id, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. Some of this information may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies" which are discussed in more detail below. We also collect various types of "clickstream" information which is information about your browsing behavior, such as entry and exit points for the ForAllRubrics Service, search terms, website addresses you visit, page views, and impressions. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. If you are under 13, we treat this information as personal information, whether or not it is combined with any other identifying information. Notwithstanding the above, we do not ask you for, access or track any geographic-location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile applications. 

Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a website when you visit. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the ForAllRubrics Service, the network knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can complete transactions you have requested and improve and personalize the ForAllRubrics Service experience by seeing which areas and features are most popular. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of the ForAllRubrics Service available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the network's features or services, and you may have a less satisfactory experience. 

Finally, if you make any purchases through the ForAllRubrics Service, billing and credit card information may be required. All such credit card transactions are fully encrypted and your billing and credit card information is collected and stored by us or a trusted third party. Any third party credit card vendor will be prohibited from using this information for any purpose other than storing the credit card.
How ForAllRubrics Uses and Shares Information About You

We try to provide you with the information you need to make informed, reasonable choices with respect to how the ForAllRubrics Service uses or shares your information. ForAllRubrics uses and shares personal information from you in several ways: 

(1) General Services. We will use information we have collected about you to provide the ForAllRubrics Service, which requires sharing your personal information with other users. If you are a teacher, you will be able to collect, review, and edit information about the students in your classroom. If you are a school administrator, you will be able to collect, review, and edit information about the students in your school. If you are a district administrator, you will be able to collect, review, and edit information about the students and teachers in your district. Each student and his or her parent will only have access to view or submit information relative to that student. Students (and their parents) will not be able to view or otherwise access the personal information of other students. As part of our services, we may use your information to communicate with you about your account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our sites and applications or changes to our policies. 

(2) Children's Personal Information. We use children's personal information for creating a student's individual account (which will identify you within your classroom), customizing the ForAllRubrics Service for you, and for sending you notifications via the ForAllRubrics Service from your teacher, school, district, other students, and from ForAllRubrics (regarding your use of the ForAllRubrics Services). Please note that a student's parent or guardian, as well as a student's teacher and an administrator from his or her school and/or district, can view all activity and content associated with such student account, including such child's personal information. 

(3) Aggregate Data. We will share aggregated and anonymized data (in a non-personally-identifiable format) with other students, parents, teachers, and school administrators so such individuals can look at statistical data related to students in a particular classroom, school, district, or geographic location. We may also share aggregated and anonymized information about you (in a non-personally-identifiable format) in order to customize and improve the ForAllRubrics Services or for marketing purposes. 

(4) Improve Our Services. We may use information we have collected about you to optimize or improve our products, services and operations. We may use information we have collected about you to detect, investigate and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.

Sharing of Your Information in Other Circumstances

In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of ForAllRubrics, our users, our employees or the public. Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.

Third Party Services

You may access other third party services, such as Google, Persona, Mozilla Backpack, and other social media websites ("Third Party Services"), through the ForAllRubrics Service in order to share certain content selected and approved by you with those services, and/or to import information about you and information about people you are connected with on those services. Some Third Party Services may also provide us with information from your accounts to enhance and personalize your use of the ForAllRubrics Service.

Links to Other Websites

The ForAllRubrics Service contains links to other websites. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Except as described above, we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of websites to which we link. Links from the ForAllRubrics Service to third parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.

Our Security Practices

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees or contractors for ForAllRubrics business purposes only. Our employees and contractors are bound by ForAllRubrics policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our users' personal information. Employees and contractors who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We maintain some physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our users' personal information. While we encrypt most of your data transmissions through the ForAllRubrics Service, some transmissions may not be encrypted and may be intercepted by third parties. Further, no data transmission over the Internet even if encrypted can be guaranteed to be private. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ForAllRubrics cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. Further, your account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. It is up to you to protect against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

Control of Personal Information

We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and to view, correct or remove your personal information. If you are a parent or guardian of a student under the age of 13, you may contact us at any time to review your child's personal information, direct us to delete it, or to prohibit any further collection or use of your child's information. However, we will retain and use your or your child's information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

To contact us directly regarding cancelling your account or correcting or removing other personal information, please email us at support@forallrubrics.com.

Site Development

THE FORALLRUBRICS SERVICE IS UNDER CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. THE FORALLRUBRICS SERVICE MAY CONTAIN BUGS AND OTHER ERRORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE FORALLRUBRICS SERVICE. ANY ISSUES OR ERRORS OF THIS NATURE MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

Your Comments or Concerns

We welcome your feedback. If you have any comments or concerns about this privacy policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us at support@forallrubrics.com.

Data Changes

If you terminate your account or delete/change your data or content, we usually update our live databases immediately. However, some data may update more slowly or may be impossible to update and remove, and some old data may remain in our archives and records. Also, we may be unable to propagate changes to partners who receive your data or content. If your account is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration.

Our Privacy Policy Will Change Over Time

Because we continue to develop the ForAllRubrics Service and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we provide, our policies will change over time. We may use personal information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy policy. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy from time to time to stay abreast of our most current privacy policy practices. We will attempt to notify registered users of any material changes in the Privacy Policy by sending an email to the user's registered email address and posting a notice on our website homepage and login page; it is your responsibility to check for updates to the Privacy Policy and any such update shall be effective even if you do not receive notice of such update. If you do not consent to the updated Privacy Policy, you can discontinue use of the ForAllRubrics Service. Your continued access and use of the ForAllRubrics Service will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to our Privacy Policy.

FERPA

Please be aware that the ForAllRubrics Service and all User Content may be subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99). FERPA is a Federal law that protects the privacy interests of students in their education records. It generally prohibits the disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information from education records without the consent of the parent or eligible student. An eligible student is one who reaches the age of 18 years old and/or attends a postsecondary educational institution, in which case the rights of the parent transfer to the student. Generally, FERPA also gives Parents or eligible students the right to inspect and review the student's education records, request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading, consent (or withhold consent) to a school releasing any information from a student's education record absent certain circumstances. A more detailed overview of FERPA can be found at the website for the U.S. Department of Education at http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html.

Any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of ForAllRubrics. 

4. The Application Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the Application or your possession and use of the Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
